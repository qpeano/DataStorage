*Two Ways*


The project is made of 2 "pathways", 2 ideas of implementing the nested information feature. The first one that actually works will be the one that is used.
As of right now (2022-09-20), both of the impelemtations are in their early stages. 

update (2022-10-07): second implementation won by a MILE, not yet done, but it is miles ahead in developement compared to 1st impllementation
